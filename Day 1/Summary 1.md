Day 1 focused on setting up the development environment and understanding the fundamentals of DNS resolution. 
I configured Visual Studio Code as the IDE and MSYS2 UCRT64 as the terminal environment, ensuring the correct C++ compiler (gcc.exe) was set in my settings. 
The Poco C++ Libraries were successfully installed using pacman, and a clean project structure was created with essential files like CMakeLists.txt and main.cpp. 
The CMakeLists.txt was written to include the necessary Poco modules such as PocoNet, PocoUtil, and PocoFoundation. 
I also built a foundational understanding of how DNS worksâ€”from the role of recursive resolvers and root servers to how TLD and authoritative servers return final IP addresses. 
The first day concluded with a complete setup that allowed me to compile and run basic C++ projects linked with Poco libraries.
